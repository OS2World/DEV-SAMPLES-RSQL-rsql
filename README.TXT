This is the RSQL program found in:

Client/Server Programming with OS/2 2.0 2nd Ed - Robert Orfali & Dan Harkey

I coded up the program in order to familiarize myself both with "C" (I'm 
from a mainframe background) and DB2/2.  I didn't bother with the bulk of
the DBA Administration functions, since they're easily available from the
command line via DBM, but the rest of the program is very SPUFI-like and
could easily be used for timing queries, benchmarking etc.
